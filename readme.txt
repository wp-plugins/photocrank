Automatically makes the photos on your blog Crankable with graphics, word bubbles and captions.

== Description ==

**Makes your photos Crankable using the PhotoCrank platform**.

Crank your photos up a notch by adding the PhotoCrank Engine to your blog.  With the PhotoCrank Engine you can instantly transform any photo or image that you post online into a very entertaining and engaging way for your visitors to interact with not only your website, but your other website visitors as well. They can do this by adding captions, images and text directly on top of any photo that once posted, everyone else can view and react to quickly and easily. We call each of these additions to the photos ‘Cranks’ and they will instantly bring your photos to life by making them more part of your website’s conversation.

Some features:

* Your visitors will spend more time on your website
* You can moderate each Crank that gets added to your website
* Any visitor can Crank and view the Cranks on the photos on your website
